Hello World
This is an app I learned how to make doing coursework for Python.
I have taken the concept and made it into a package that can be distributed to my friends, family and collegues.

Why is this good?
If you have ever had to do massive amounts of data transfer for your job. (ala Copy and Paste)
This app would save you tons of time simply by removing the need to Paste the contents after you Copied them. 

How normal data transfer might look:
1. Select-drag or right click hyperlink in a browser/file
2. Ctrl-C or right click to copy data to clipboard
3. Switch to textfile or spreadsheet where you are saving this data 
4. Ctrl-v or right click to paste 
5. Switch back to browser 

How cliprec.py helps you transfer data easier:
1. Select-drag or right click hyperlink in a browser/file
2. Ctrl-C or right click to copy data to clipboard

Summary
This app simply records what you are copying on your computer. Without you having to manually save it somewhere. 
Just keep working on your task and this app will save you some time in the long run.

My Special Additions:
-Added a feature so that when the app is exited (Ctrl-C), all content saved thus far is added to your clipboard.
-Instructions on the app and its use are done by me.
